# Friday Night Funkin | MintEngine

Engine originally used for [FNF MelodyMania](https://gamebanana.com/wips/90861), this minty-fresh fork of [P-Slice Engine](https://github.com/Psych-Slice/P-Slice) is slightly tweaked for my new modding needs, allowing video introductions, a revamped mod folder layout, and the entirety of the base FNF content being done in a modpack.

## Installation

Refer to Psych Engine's [Building Instructions](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/docs/BUILDING.md) to learn how to compile the engine.

## Mod Creation

The MintEngine mod folder layout is different compared to Psych/P-Slice, so if you want to make a mod on here, then use [this template](https://github.com/bobbydeluxe/funkin-mint-basemod).
